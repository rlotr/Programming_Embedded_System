/*
  SD card read/write

  This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file
  The circuit. Pin numbers reflect the default
  SPI pins for Uno and Nano models:
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** SDO - pin 11
 ** SDI - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4 (For For Uno, Nano: pin 10. For MKR Zero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)

  SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MISO - pin 22 on Arancino Mignon
 ** MOSI - pin 23 on Arancino Mignon
 ** SCK - pin 24 on Arancino Mignon
 ** CS - pin 9 on Arancino Mignon
