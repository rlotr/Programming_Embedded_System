## üéì Thesis Overview

The aim of this thesis is to provide a structured and practice-oriented approach to learning embedded programming, using the **Arancino Mignon** platform as a base for developing a wide range of educational projects. Starting from fundamental examples involving basic input/output and signal control, the work progressively explores more complex applications involving sensors, actuators, real-time data logging, and IoT connectivity.

Each project included in this repository is designed to be self-contained, replicable, and educational, with well-commented code, hardware schematics, and component lists.
